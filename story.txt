I thought it would be another typical day where I would drive my Porsche around town, but little did I know that would not be the case.
While I was driving down the Haupstrasse, a Hund jumped in front of me, and I barely managed to slam my brakes in time to avoid him.
Thankfully I always keep brots in the glove compartment, so after I put my Porsche in park, I stepped out to reward  him for being a good boy but to also remind him that roads are no place for hunds. 
Now, it is time to head into Berlin where I will stop at the local hot spot for some delicous bratwurst.
After savoring the delicious Bratwurst, I decided to explore the historic Schloss nearby, admiring its magnificent architecture and rich history.
Next, I was off to my favorite Baeckerei for some of their mouth-wateringly good Apfelkuchen.
With my tastebuds still demanding attention, I decided to style out in my Lederhorse and head to the Biergarten.
As I drive there in my freshly detailed BMW, I see planes taking off from the Flughafen through my passenger-side window.
I noticed the familiar sounds of a Rammstein concert echoing from a nearby venue, promising an electrifying end to an unexpectedly adventurous day.
So to pass the time, I decide to enjoy the music at a nearby ratskeller and enjoy the gebaeck.
As I was enjoying the music, I suddenly felt like I forgot something important: What happened to my Porche, and when did I get that new BMW?
